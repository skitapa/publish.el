Terminal publish
================

This is a description and a script to automate the publishing of some file to a server.

My problem was that I wanted to be able to publish files from GNU Emacs and could not find a package for it.

This will be a work in progress and I am not responisble for any bad things that might happen to your files.
You are responisble for whatever happens if you use this script. I prefer you first look through the code before using it.

The goal is to have a single script command to publish your file interactivly to your server.
